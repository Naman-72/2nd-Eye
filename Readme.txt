## Here are all the learnings that I am gonna have with the creation of extension 
what is a chrome extension ? An add-on that has a complete access to the DOM [Document Object Model] , 
What is a DOM ? That I don't know , Need to find , will come back 

> A chrome extension is essentially made of 4 parts 
a. Popup [ the popup is the part which you interact , it is when you click the icon ] 
b. manifest [ the information about the extension , it can be permissions , name , id , etc ]
c. content scripts [what does an extension do ]
d. background scripts 

How do I measure my progress : 
1. ship it fast 


npm install -g create-react-app

1. time spent as active + windows focussed 
2. it will be per full url 
3. timeframe : Day wise till 1 month 

4. Since Latest I will go with v3 
5. background worker + storage 

6. my data records time total ms 
7. update frequency when tab switch or windows focussed changes or closed 

8. navigation changes , window focus changes , active tab changes all 

9. for now display in a table format with time as the top most priprity
